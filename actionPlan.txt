Steps Required:
- Understand what needs to be done: 
  - Read up on Web-Scraping, try out the tutorial located here: https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-using-selenium-python-8a60f4cf40ab
  - How do we build our ML model?  
    - Utilize Classification for the Model
	->for training dataset, this website has a tutorial: https://data-flair.training/blogs/train-test-set-in-python-ml/
		-import dataset using pandas
		-use scikit learn to split the data b/w labels and features
	->for classification, use sklearn also
		-documentation for sklearn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html
		-but which classification method should we use?
			-here are some classification algorithms to consider:
				K-Nearest Neighbors
				Support Vector Machines
				Decision Tree Classifiers/Random Forests
				Naive Bayes
				Linear Discriminant Analysis
				Logistic Regression

    - Calculate Mean Squared Error on Dataset
	->sklearn has a function for mean squared error calculation
		-https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html
		-geeeksforgeeks tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-mean-squared-error/

    - Python Programming Language
    
    Go to the TA to check on implementation plan
    
 - Implement
 - Test Implementation
 - Verify Submission Criteria
 
 
Timeline:
- October 29th: Have a plan of action, do independent research on the way to approach questions above.
- October 28th or November 2nd: Go to TA to verfify plan.
- November 9th: Work on implementation, get help from TA as needed.
- November 16th: Complete testing of implementation, make changes as needed. (added extra buffer before the deadline as padding)
- November 20th: Confirm submission details.
- Novmeber 23rd: Submit by 11:59pm.
